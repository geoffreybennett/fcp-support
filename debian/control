Description: Support package for Focusrite Control Protocol
 This package provides support for Focusrite Control Protocol (FCP)
 devices, including tools for device management and configuration.
 It includes both fcp-tool for user interaction and fcp-server for
 device management.
 .
 The package automatically sets up udev rules and systemd services
 for automatic device detection and management. When a compatible
 device is connected, a systemd service instance (fcp-server@.service)
 is automatically started for that specific device.
