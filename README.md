# Linux FCP (Focusrite Control Protocol) Support Tools

This repository provides the user-space components required for full
functionality of Focusrite USB audio interfaces that use the Linux FCP
driver.

## System Overview

FCP support in Linux consists of several components that work together:

1. **Kernel Driver** ([linux-fcp](https://github.com/geoffreybennett/linux-fcp))
   - Allows `fcp-server` to communicate with the device

2. **User-space Server** (this repo: `fcp-server`)
   - Communicates with the device via the kernel driver
   - Creates ALSA controls and transfers control changes to and from
     the device
   - Allows `fcp-firmware` to update the device firmware, reset the
     device configuration, and reboot the device

3. **Firmware Update Tool** (this repo: `fcp-firmware`)
   - CLI utility for updating device firmware
   - Uploads firmware to `fcp-server`

4. **GUI Application** ([alsa-scarlett-gui](https://github.com/geoffreybennett/alsa-scarlett-gui))
   - Provides a graphical interface for device control
   - Uses the ALSA controls created by `fcp-server`

## Supported Devices

The currently supported devices are:

- Scarlett 4th Gen 16i16, 18i16, and 18i20

The FCP driver itself supports all Focusrite USB audio interfaces
since the 2nd Gen Scarletts, so support for the other devices will be
added here later. Until then, the Linux Scarlett2 driver supports all
the other 2nd Gen and later Scarlett, Clarett USB, Clarett+, and
Vocaster devices.

## Prerequisites

1. The FCP kernel driver must be installed.

2. Required packages for building:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install build-essential libasound2-dev libsystemd-dev \
  libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libjson-c-dev pkg-config

# Fedora
sudo dnf install make gcc alsa-lib-devel systemd-devel openssl-devel \
  zlib-devel json-c-devel pkgconfig
```

3. Audio group membership is required to use the `fcp-firmware` tool:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G audio $USER
```

Log out and back in for the group membership change to take effect.

### Installation

1. Build and install:

```bash
make
sudo make install
```

This will:
- Build `fcp-server` and `fcp-firmware`
- Install binaries to `/usr/local/bin/`
- Install systemd service file to `/usr/local/lib/systemd/system/`
- Install udev rule to `/usr/local/lib/udev/rules.d/`
- Install data files to `/usr/local/share/fcp-server/`

2. Reload systemd and udev:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

## Configuration

The installation process sets up:

1. **Systemd Service**: `fcp-server@.service`
   - Started automatically when a compatible device is detected
   - One instance per device (e.g., `fcp-server@1.service`)

2. **Udev Rules**:
   - Start systemd service when device is connected

## Usage

### Device Management

1. Normal operation:

  - Plug in the device
  - Server starts automatically
  - Check status with `systemctl status fcp-server@*`

2. Troubleshooting:

  - Watch the system log when connecting the device: `journalctl -f`
  - Stop the FCP server: `sudo systemctl stop fcp-server@*`
  - Get the card number with `aplay -l`
  - Start the FCP server manually with debug logging: `LOG_LEVEL=debug fcp-server <card-number>`

### Firmware Management

The `fcp-firmware` tool provides the following capabilities:

```bash
# View all commands
fcp-firmware

# Update firmware (takes 1-2 minutes)
fcp-firmware update <firmware.bin>

# Maintenance commands
fcp-firmware erase-config   # Reset device configuration to firmware defaults
fcp-firmware reboot         # Reboot device
```
